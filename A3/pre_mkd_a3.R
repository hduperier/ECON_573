  print("2a). The lasso, relative to least squares, is less flexible and hence will give improved prediction accuracy when its increase in bias is less than its decrease in variance which proves iii to be correct since the lasso will have better predictions as bias increrases and variances decreases or remains the same.")
  print("2b). The ridge regression, relative to least squares, is less flexible and hence will give improved prediction accuracy when its increase in bias is less than its decrease in variance which proves iii to be correct since the ridge regression will have better predictions as bias increrases and variances decreases or remains the same, similar to the lasso.")
